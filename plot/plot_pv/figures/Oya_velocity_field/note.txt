In Oya et al. 2014, the assumption of the velocity field is that there is no gas inside the centrifugal barrier, i.e.,
no rotationally supported disk structure is considered.

On the other hand, 'expansion' means that the velocity inside the centrifugal barrier is outflowing (namely, there is gas inside the cb),
and the value of the speed is the same as inflow.
