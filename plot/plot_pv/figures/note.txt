These figures share some common inputs:

d/g     : 0.01
Mstar   : 0.14 Msun
Mdot    : Mstar *1e-5/yr
Radius  : 70 au 
vinfall : 1 Keplerian velocity

Gas is set to be absent inside Rcb if Rcb is not None, i.e., there is not gas inside the centrifugal barrier.
The abundances of methanol inside and outside the snowline are 1e-10 and 1e-5, respectively.
You can adjust the enhancement by adjusting the input in problem_setup, i.e., 'abundance_enhancement'.
